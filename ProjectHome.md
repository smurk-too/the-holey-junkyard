# Important #
The development of this repository has been shifted to [Githib](https://github.com/). For further updates please visit [our Github repository](https://github.com/mjuvekar7/the-holey-junkyard).

# What? #
It's an open platform where we put all our code and all our ideas (currently there are more ideas than code) in an effort to do something productive that will somehow, one day, help the world. Developing, experimenting, and innovating alone is helping nobody -- it only makes sense if it's available to everybody and connected to everything. So we came up with this 'junkyard', and, in a  word, it's fun.

## Current projects ##
(see 'Source' for more information)
  * VoteCounter: a vote counting machine
  * a 3D LED cube, with a neat interface
  * mathinator: a Python-based word problem solver

## Old projects ##
  * AVR-based automatic gate opener/closer
  * LCD driver libraries for AVRs
  * timer driver libraries for AVRs
  * various Python utilities
  * TV remote decoder
We might take these into development if they are wanted!

## Ideas in development ##
(again, see 'Source' for more information)
  * improvements on the basic LED cube using a Raspberry Pi (finally a Pi!)
  * a Python word problem solver
  * a method to control a Raspberry Pi with a Wii remote
  * and much more...

# How? #
Have an idea? Any old code lying around which might be useful? Send it in or become a contributor! That's how we started, and now we have a proper, versioned collection which anybody can contribute to.

# Who? #
Right now, we're just two developers -- 'mandarj' and 'shardulc' -- but everyone's help will be appreciated. Email us at mjuvekar7@gmail.com or shardul.chiplunkar@gmail.com to contribute.
