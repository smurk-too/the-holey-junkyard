blinker sub-directory -- AVR direvtory, SVN repository
author: mandar

This is the README file located in the blinker subdirectory
of the AVR directory of the repository. It contains code for
a very simple blinker program.
The directory has one subdirectory and six files as eplained 
below-- 

Directories --
alternate/
	This directory contains source code and output files
	for a simple rpogram to have two LEDs blink in an 
	alternate fashion.

Files --
blink.c
	This is the actual source code for the program. It is
	a simple fragment of code. Please read comments in the
	code in order to understand its working.

blink.hex and blink.elf
	These are the pre-compiled output files for the program
	ready to be burnt on an AVR.
	Note: these files are compiled to work with an Atmega16
	working at 8MHz. Donot change these files unless you
	what you are doing.
	These files can be recompiled and burnt using the Makefile.

blink.lst
	This is a file showing the C code and assembly code for the
	program side-by-side.
	It can be used for a comparative study of both landuages.

blink.out
	This file is needed for the compiling of the .lst file
	(see above).

Makefile
	This file is a useful file to compile and burn the
	program. It is self-explanatory, yet, instructions are
	given below--
	Fill in the TARGET, MCU and F_CPU variables of
	the Makefile according to your microcontroller.
	Usage--
	--make: compiles the code.
	--make burn: burns all pre-compiled code on device
	--make all: does both of the above.
	--make show_assembly: creates .lst file to show assembly 
			      code alongside C code.
	--make clean: removes all created files exept source.
